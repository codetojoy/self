I don't necessarily endorse the sentiment of the quote, or the person. As a
writer, I appreciate a good line (or moment in history).

This is a long list, as there is a small chance that this will be a lightning
talk one day. An excellent quote has a lasting impression on me; I encountered
some of these many years (decades!) ago.
